# Subagent Pipeline

Use this to execute one issue end to end with independent, cold-start subagents instead of one agent implementing and self-reviewing.

## Why Cold-Start

An agent that wrote the code cannot judge its own intent objectively. A fresh reviewer agent that has only the issue and the diff can only judge what the code does, not what the implementer meant. That gap is where bugs hide. Do not let the implementer review its own PR.

## Preconditions

- The issue exists and is claimed (`picked by agent` or the project's equivalent label) before any subagent starts.
- Check the issue's stated dependencies. If a blocking issue is still open, resolve it first or get explicit sign-off to build against a stub.
- Confirm which branch is actually current. If the local checkout is behind the deploy target (for example a solo-maintained `staging` that lags a local feature branch), branch the worktree from the remote target branch, not from the locally checked-out branch.

## Workflow

1. **Implementer subagent** — cold start, full write access, own git worktree per issue (for example `/tmp/<repo>-issue-<n>`), branched from the target base branch. Give it: the issue body, the base-branch commit to branch from, relevant existing conventions and file paths already discovered by prior research, explicit out-of-scope boundaries, and the exact PR target branch. It writes code, writes or updates tests, and commits without AI co-author lines — but does not push or open a PR yet.
2. **Cold preflight review, before any push** — a separate cold-start pass, in the same worktree, reads the issue and the local diff (`git diff` against the base branch) before the change ever reaches GitHub. This catches what step 3's reviewer would otherwise flag on a live PR, at the cost of one local round-trip instead of a public comment thread and a re-review on every subsequent push. Apply the blocker-severity policy below; the implementer or fixer resolves blocking findings locally, then the implementer pushes and opens the PR against the base branch (`staging`, or `main` if no staging exists), reporting the PR URL, files touched, and anything it was unsure about.
3. **Reviewer subagent** — separate cold start. Choose the reviewer model and reasoning effort by the PR's risk and complexity: cheaper/faster settings for simple changes; stronger/higher-effort settings for complex, security-sensitive, payment, auth, database, or production-critical changes. Give it only the PR number, repo, and instruction to read the diff and the linked issue itself — do not hand it the implementer's rationale or your own analysis; a reviewer that inherits the implementer's framing stops being independent. Mechanical checks — linting, formatting, conventional style, straightforward static-analysis findings, and CI test/build results — are Alibaba Code Review's and CI's job, recorded via `ai-agent-pr-metadata`; before starting its own review, the reviewer must read what Alibaba Code Review and CI already posted on the PR and must not repeat resolved mechanical findings. It may revisit an Alibaba Code Review or CI finding only when it signals an unresolved correctness, security, data-loss, configuration, or acceptance-criteria issue. Have it verify claims instead of trusting them: read the actual dependency/contract code the PR consumes (for example, the exact query params a signed URL generator produces vs. what the consuming route expects), not just the diff in isolation. Its own scope is semantic: business logic and edge cases, regressions and compatibility, security and authorization, API/database/queue/integration contracts, and test adequacy including missing acceptance tests — CI is still the hard merge gate and this reviewer is not tasked with rerunning lint to duplicate it. It must post real inline PR comments (`gh pr review` or `gh api .../pulls/{n}/comments`), not just summarize back to you — the next subagent reads GitHub, not this conversation. Label blocking findings explicitly (e.g. "Blocking") in the comment body, because `--request-changes` fails when the reviewing token is also the PR author, and `--comment` is the fallback in that case. Apply the same blocker-severity policy: only correctness/security/data-loss/missing-acceptance-test findings are blocking.
4. **Fixer subagent** — cold start, reads review comments via `gh api repos/.../pulls/.../comments`, works in the same worktree the implementer used (not a new one), records a disposition for every latest-head OCR finding, addresses each blocking finding, adds or updates tests, pushes follow-up commits to the same branch (no new PR).
5. **Final OCR/CI settling gate** — after the final push, wait for OCR and CI to settle. Run the `ai-agent-pr-metadata` final OCR disposition gate against the current head SHA. Each latest-head OCR finding must use `Disposition: fixed`, `Disposition: deferred`, or `Disposition: declined` plus one concise sentence that preserves the decision. An undispositioned finding blocks merge. Only correctness, security, data integrity, and acceptance-criteria findings are blocking and must be fixed; do not convert non-blocking suggestions into blanket code churn.
6. **CI gate** — do not merge until CI is green on the PR and the final OCR disposition gate passes. If CI is flaky, rerun once, then record the flake evidence and require human approval before proceeding.
7. **Merge** — auto-merge (`gh pr merge --squash --auto`) to `staging` once CI and the final OCR disposition gate pass. Always require human approval before merging to `main`.
8. **Chain to the next issue** — if a second issue depends on this one, wait for the merge, refetch the base branch, and branch the next issue's worktree from the merged commit, not from the pre-merge state.

## Blocker-Severity Policy

- Blocking: correctness bugs, security issues, data loss or data-integrity risk, and missing tests for stated acceptance criteria.
- Not blocking: style, wording, speculative "what if" defensive suggestions, and refactor preferences that don't change behavior. Note these but don't relitigate them pre-PR or post-PR.
- Mechanical — not the reviewer's job at all: linting, formatting, conventional style, and straightforward static-analysis findings already covered by Alibaba Code Review or CI. Don't note these even as non-blocking; they're not this reviewer's scope, and repeating them is noise, not thoroughness.
- Apply this policy at both review points (preflight and the live PR reviewer) so the same finding isn't re-raised twice in different words.
- Target 0-3 actionable findings surviving to the live PR after preflight. Zero is not the goal — it usually means the reviewer rubber-stamped rather than actually checked claims.

## Guardrails

- One worktree per issue. Never mix two issues' changes in the same worktree or branch.
- Give each subagent a self-contained prompt: file paths, exact conventions already found by research, and what's explicitly out of scope. A prompt that says "based on what we discussed, implement it" defeats the point of a cold start.
- The reviewer's job is to falsify the implementer's claims, not summarize them. If the implementer flagged its own risk, have the reviewer independently confirm whether it is real and blocking, rather than repeating the implementer's own assessment.
- If the reviewer finds a real defect, fix it before merge — do not merge on "mostly fine."
- Never skip the preflight or PR review step because the diff looks small. Skip subagent overhead only when the change is trivial by the project's own non-trivial-PR definition.
- Every subagent prompt must include the bail-out contract: if the subagent cannot finish (context exhaustion, blocked dependency, session limit), it writes a `handover`, posts it to the issue, and adds the `paused by agent` label instead of stopping silently.
- Public issues, PRs, comments, and handovers must never include credential values or local credential-file paths. Use `Credential details: [redacted]`.

## Outcome evaluation

The deterministic checks in `eval/` protect this skill's written contract and
the schema of synthetic held-out cases. They do not score whether merely
loading this skill changed an agent response.

Use the approved isolated harness described in `eval/README.md` to compare
user-visible outcomes and safety outcomes with the skill enabled versus disabled.
Retain the skill only when its enabled condition clears the stated
threshold, improves the aggregate outcome rate, and has no safety regression;
otherwise investigate or retire the skill.
